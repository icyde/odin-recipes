    <p> Great. I use 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter. Slip season solode down on cast iron grill heated as high as you can on the bbq. Then season top before closing grill. Flip after 2 minutes and grill other side for 2 minutes.</p>
    <p>I made this with cod and my family really liked it. I pan fried it for about 2 mins /side (each piece was about 3 inches long). It was too spicy for us and I only used 1/2 of the cayenne pepper. I think next time I will reduce the black pepper as well. Otherwise it was delicious!</p>
