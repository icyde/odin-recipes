# odin-recipes

This project is part of the Odin Project, odin-recipes features a website which consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I will have implemented basic html skills by the completion of this project, such as headers, paragraphs, ordered & unordered lists, images, gifs and hrefs!
